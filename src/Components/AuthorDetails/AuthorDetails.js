        desc:"Salusfin has received excellent service and delivery from Mobiversal, starting from our initial discussions, and ongoing to the first ready product. In the initial phase we had several technical discussions to ensure we were on the same track and that the supplier could deliver. It has also been very easy to work with them from abroad. Mobiversal assigned their CTO to discussions with our team and we got the confidence that they would be able to deliver the goods. That was a very good decision and Mobiversal has delivered on their promise. From the start we had a PM allocated from Mobiversal that has been our central contact throughout the project and it has been a good working cooperation which we could highlight as the ball was never dropped and delivery of new versions have been as expected and on time, and in some cases with improved ideas. We also moved the UI design to Mobiversal as the team had really fresh ideas and a good understanding of our needs.",

Alin, Adrian and Cristian along with their designer - Razvan, took a very challenging RFP with a ton of specifications and effectively pulled it all together into a clean and elegant design. The team was always patient with changes that needed to be made along the way. Not only am I delighted with the results, I am also happy to recommend Mobiversal and their services to anyone considering creating a business from the ground up.",

        desc:"I was looking very carefully for quite a while for a team to develop my iOS game `Find a Way, Jose` and after considering about 15 different development solutions, I have finally decided to hire Mobiversal. The experience was great, since the initial stages, milestone deliveries, QA cycles, App Store deployment, and till this very day when we are about to update for the fifth time with exciting new features. Although Mobiversal is an offshore solution for me, working with them I totally have the feeling that Alin, Flavius, Cristian, Ovidiu (and the rest of the bunch) are an integral part of my team. It is great to know that they regard the success of my app to be their success too and take pride in it. Reliable, quick, professional, sympathetic and with great communication skills I couldn`t ask for more. No wonder I recommend Mobiversal to my peers, whenever I`m asked if I know any good iPhone application development company.",

From our nine-month experience of working together I personally find them both professional, reliable and trustworthy. We had requested MANY changes along the way, which were answered in high quality and within a timely manner. Overall, we were very pleased from the experience of working with Mobiversal and we plan to work with them on more projects in the future.",

We have outsourced 100% of our app, web and sever based development to Mobiversal. They sure have earned our trust. Mobiversal has provided a scalable solution that achieves our objectives and enables us to maintain a high level of service to our customers. Mobiversal has demonstrated real ownership and commitment to deliver for our customers and it`s this dedication that makes our relationship work and produces winning results. Mobiversals` creative use of technology solutions is helping us diversify our business model and generate revenue from different sources other than our core services. Their quality-assurance capabilities, excellent internal development processes and around-the-clock support have helped us achieve significant cost savings from our offshore initiative. They were very responsive and worked hard to make our website, apps and backend tools exactly what we had envisioned. Understanding the needs of customers is the Key to any successful business. Mobiversal perfectly understands these needs and knows how to translate them into applicable products. We`ll be using them again and again and again in the future. We are very impressed with Mobiversal.",
